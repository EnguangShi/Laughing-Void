React Context helps you manage shared state across components without passing props manually through every level of the component tree. In this note, we'll create a shopping cart context to demonstrate how to use and consume context effectively.

## Table of Contents

## 1. What is Prop Drilling?

**Prop Drilling** occurs when you need to pass data through multiple components, even if only the deeply nested components require it. For example:

```js
function App() {
  const items = ["item1", "item2"];

  return <Parent items={items} />;
}

function Parent({ items }) {
  return <Child items={items} />;
}

function Child({ items }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map(item => (
        <li key={item}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

Here, the `items` prop has to be passed through `Parent` even though it doesn't use the data. This makes the code harder to maintain as the component structure grows.

## 2. What is React Context?

**React Context** provides a way to share values between components without passing props manually at every level. It helps eliminate prop drilling by making data available globally to components.

## 3. Creating a Context

To create a React context, use the `createContext` function. Place the context in a separate file for better organization.

**File: `shopping-cart-context.jsx`**

```js
import { createContext } from "react";

// Create the context with a default value
export const CartContext = createContext({
  items: [],
});
```

## 4. Providing Context to Components

Wrap your components with a **Provider** to make the context data available.

**File: `App.jsx`**

```js
import { CartContext } from "./store/shopping-cart-context";

function App() {
  const cartValue = { items: [] };

  return (
    <CartContext.Provider value={cartValue}>
      <Header />
      <Shop />
    </CartContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

- **`value` Prop**: The value prop is required for the `Provider` and holds the shared data.

## 5. Consuming Context in Components

To access the context value, use the `useContext` hook.

**File: `Cart.jsx`**

```js
import { useContext } from "react";
import { CartContext } from "../store/shopping-cart-context";

export default function Cart() {
  const { items } = useContext(CartContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Cart Items</h2>
      {items.length === 0 ? (
        <p>No items in cart!</p>
      ) : (
        <ul>
          {items.map(item => (
            <li key={item}>{item}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Why `useContext`?

- The `useContext` hook reads the current context value and re-renders the component when the context changes.

## 6. Default Context Values

The value you pass to `createContext` is the **default value**. It is only used if a component tries to consume the context but is not wrapped in a `Provider`.

For example:

```js
const CartContext = createContext({ items: [] });

function App() {
  return <Cart />; // Not wrapped in CartContext.Provider
}
```

Here, `Cart` will still receive `{ items: [] }` as the context value.

It also improves **auto-completion** in your IDE, making development smoother.

## 7. Why Context Helps

React Context simplifies data sharing by:

1. **Avoiding Prop Drilling**: No need to pass props through every component.
2. **Centralized Data**: Shared data like shopping cart items can be managed in one place.

### Final Thoughts

React Context is a powerful tool for managing global state, especially when prop drilling becomes unmanageable. By using `createContext`, `Provider`, and `useContext`, you can make state accessible across your component tree.
