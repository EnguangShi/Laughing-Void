When state management in React becomes complex, especially when working with objects or arrays, `useReducer` provides an alternative to `useState`. Combined with React Context, it allows you to centralize state logic and make updates easier to manage.

## Table of Contents

## 1. Why useReducer?

When you manage state with `useState`, updating the state often involves repetitive code, especially when changes depend on the previous state. For example:

```jsx
const [shoppingCart, setShoppingCart] = useState({
  items: [],
});

function handleAddItemToCart(id) {
  setShoppingCart(prevState => {
    const updatedItems = [...prevState.items];
    const existingItem = updatedItems.find(item => item.id === id);

    if (existingItem) {
      existingItem.quantity += 1;
    } else {
      updatedItems.push({ id, quantity: 1 });
    }

    return { ...prevState, items: updatedItems };
  });
}
```

Here, the logic is complex, repetitive, and hard to maintain as your app grows.

## 2. What is useReducer?

`useReducer` simplifies state management by using a **reducer function** to handle all state updates. A **reducer** is a function that takes the current state and an action, then returns the updated state.

### Benefits of useReducer:

1. **Centralized Logic**: All state update logic lives in one function.
2. **Simpler State Updates**: No need to repeat the function form of `setState`.
3. **Improved Readability**: State updates are dispatched as actions.

## 3. Setting Up useReducer

To use `useReducer`, follow these steps:

### 1. Define the Reducer Function

The reducer function accepts two arguments:

- `state`: The current state.
- `action`: An object describing what to update.

```jsx
function cartReducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === "ADD_ITEM") {
    const updatedItems = [...state.items];
    const existingItem = updatedItems.find(item => item.id === action.payload);

    if (existingItem) {
      existingItem.quantity += 1;
    } else {
      updatedItems.push({ id: action.payload, quantity: 1 });
    }

    return { ...state, items: updatedItems };
  }

  if (action.type === "UPDATE_ITEM") {
    const updatedItems = state.items.map(item =>
      item.id === action.payload.id
        ? { ...item, quantity: item.quantity + action.payload.amount }
        : item
    );

    return { ...state, items: updatedItems.filter(item => item.quantity > 0) };
  }

  return state; // Default case
}
```

### 2. Use useReducer in Your Component

Call `useReducer` and pass in the reducer function and an initial state.

## 4. Why useReducer with Context?

1. **Centralized State Management**: `useReducer` combines all state updates in one place.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: The reducer function keeps state logic separate from components.
3. **Simpler Components**: Components dispatch actions instead of managing complex logic.
4. **Scalable**: Easily manage complex state and add new actions.

By combining `useReducer` and React Context, you can create a clean, scalable state management system for your application.
