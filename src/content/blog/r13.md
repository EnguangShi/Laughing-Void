## When to Split Components

### 1. Why Split Components?

There are a couple of important reasons to split your components into smaller, reusable pieces:

### 2. Reason 1: App.jsx is Too Long

When your `App.jsx` file or any component file becomes very long and difficult to manage, it's time to split the component into smaller ones. Smaller components are easier to understand, test, and maintain.

### 3. Reason 2: Avoid Unnecessary Re-Renders

When a component contains multiple parts, a state change in one part may unnecessarily trigger a re-render of the entire component. For example, if a component has both part A and part B, and only part A needs to be updated when the state changes, part B will also be re-rendered if they are in the same component.

By splitting the component into two separate files (e.g., `PartA.jsx` and `PartB.jsx`), you ensure that only the part that needs to update is re-rendered, improving performance and avoiding unnecessary work for React.

### 4. Conclusion

Splitting components not only helps in organizing your code but also improves the performance of your React app by minimizing unnecessary re-renders.
