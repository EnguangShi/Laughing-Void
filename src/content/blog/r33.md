React Context is powerful not only for sharing static values but also for dynamically linking state and providing state-updating functions. This approach eliminates the need for **prop drilling** and allows components to directly interact with shared state.

## Introduction to Linking State with Context

In the previous notes, we learned how to provide and consume context to share static values between components. However, React Context becomes truly powerful when it is **linked to state** and can also share functions that update that state.

The key benefit:

- Share dynamic state and state-updating functions across components without using props.

## 1. Setting Up Context with Initial Values

First, create a **context** and define its initial values. Add placeholders for any functions you want to expose. This ensures better auto-completion and avoids errors.

### shopping-cart-context.jsx

```jsx
import { createContext } from "react";

export const CartContext = createContext({
  items: [], // Default items array
  addItemToCart: () => {}, // Placeholder function for auto-completion
});
```

## 2. Linking State with Context

To make the context dynamic, link it with state in the parent component. Provide both the state and state-updating functions as the `value` of the context provider.

### App.jsx

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { CartContext } from "./store/shopping-cart-context";
import Product from "./components/Product";

function App() {
  const [shoppingCart, setShoppingCart] = useState({ items: [] });

  function handleAddItemToCart(id) {
    setShoppingCart(prevCart => {
      const updatedItems = [...prevCart.items];
      const existingItemIndex = updatedItems.findIndex(item => item.id === id);

      if (existingItemIndex >= 0) {
        updatedItems[existingItemIndex] = {
          ...updatedItems[existingItemIndex],
          quantity: updatedItems[existingItemIndex].quantity + 1,
        };
      } else {
        updatedItems.push({ id, quantity: 1 });
      }

      return { items: updatedItems };
    });
  }

  // Define context value
  const cartValue = {
    items: shoppingCart.items,
    addItemToCart: handleAddItemToCart,
  };

  return (
    <CartContext.Provider value={cartValue}>
      <h1>React Shop</h1>
      <Product id={1} title="Product 1" />
      <Product id={2} title="Product 2" />
    </CartContext.Provider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Key Points**:

1. `useState` holds the shopping cart items.
2. The `handleAddItemToCart` function updates the state.
3. The context `value` now includes both the `items` state and the `handleAddItemToCart` function.

## 3. Consuming Context in Child Components

Child components can access the shared state and functions using `useContext`. This eliminates the need to pass props.

### Product.jsx

```jsx
import { useContext } from "react";
import { CartContext } from "../store/shopping-cart-context";

export default function Product({ id, title }) {
  const { addItemToCart } = useContext(CartContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => addItemToCart(id)}>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**What Happens Here?**

- `useContext` retrieves the context value.
- `addItemToCart` is directly called to update the state.

## 4. Benefits of Linking State with Context

- **Centralized State Management**: Shared state is maintained in one place.
- **Simplified Component Communication**: No need for prop drilling.
- **Direct Updates**: Expose state-updating functions via context.

## Summary

By linking state with context and providing state-updating functions, we can:

- Dynamically share and update state across components.
- Reduce the need for props.
- Improve code readability and maintainability.

This is a fundamental approach to managing global-like state in React applications, especially when working with deeply nested components.
